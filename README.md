- 👋  Hi, I’m @tomerik-puzzled
- 👀  I’m interested in lots of things... maybe too many things. 
-     Some of my favorite things are tennis, escape games (especially hidden doors), movies and Norwegian waffles.
- 💞️  This github profile is mainly to host elements for my escape games. Such as the JS plugins, virtual elements and other things.
      However, if you made it here, feel free to play complete digital versions of some games I have made. Click on the name of the game, and there'll be a starting link. 
      You can also check out a children's book I wrote and graphically designed. It's called The Floor is Full of Sharks. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and how to make a masonry pizza oven. 
- 📫 If you want to get a hold of me, email me at tomerik@puzzledescapegames.com or tomerik@gmail.com
