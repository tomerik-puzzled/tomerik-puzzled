- 👋  Hi, I’m Tom Erik

- 👀  I’m interested in lots of things... maybe too many things. 
      Some of my favorite things are tennis, escape games (especially hidden doors), movies and Norwegian waffles.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning python and how to make a masonry pizza oven.

-     This github profile is mainly to host elements for my escape games. Such as the JS plugins, virtual elements and other things.
      
- 💞️  However, if you made it here, feel free to play complete digital versions of some online room escape games I have made. 
      
      In the public CoffeeCups folder, you'll find a Readme file that explains how to start that game.  
      
      You can play The Professor of the Occult by going here: https://www.theprofessoroftheoccult.com/scenes/XHASAS/pregame
      You can play The Box From The Future by going here: https://www.theboxfromthefuture.com/pages/index/NSHSAS
      
      If you have played, and really liked it, please consider buying them for yourself or someone else as a gift at:

      You can also check out a children's book I wrote and graphically designed. It's called The Floor is Full of Sharks.
